# `codex/` (Project Rules & Skills)

This folder contains project-local rules and reusable skills intended for Codex and human reviewers.

- `rules/`: Markdown rules (adapted to this repo’s iOS + FastAPI stack).
- `skills/`: `SKILL.md`-based workflows (PRD writing, code review, release hardening, etc.).

These files are documentation; Codex will only follow them when they are referenced or when the session’s agent configuration loads them.
